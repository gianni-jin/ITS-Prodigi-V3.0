# Project Overview

## Introduction
ITS Prodigi V3.0 is a back-end school management application that builds upon my two previous, much simpler Java projects, started over five months ago. 

The application enables school administrators to add new students, teachers, courses, classes, and programs to the database, modify existing entries, delete them, and establish relationships between them. Additionally, users can perform search operations using certain parameters to filter through the database. 


## Technologies Used
The back-end is built with Spring Boot and Hibernate/JPA. I've also used SQL/JBQL to write some custom/non-CRUD queries. The database of choice for this project is MySQL. 

As for now, it doen not have a front-end part. I wanted to use Angular at the beginning, but due to time constaints, I wasn't able to study the framework well enough up to the point of starting to use it. 

For API testing, I've used Postman. For API documentation, I've used Swagger UI/Open API.

## The Origin of the Idea

After gaining a foundational understanding of Spring and Hibernate, I wanted apply this knowledge and deepen the knowledge. The idea of designing my program to meet the needs of a familiar environment appealed to me. And since I had already built two Java projects on school management, I wanted to take a step further and build the same idea but with spring/hibernate as back-end.

## Future Plans

The project is currently in its initial stages. I plan to incorporate additional functionalities such as authentication and authorization, logging, among others. I also intend to add more related entities to increase the complexity of the program. Furthermore, I want to add the front-end part using as Angular or React.


## API Documentation

Upon launching the program, we can go to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/ to access to the list of rest endpoints of the program:
